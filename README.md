An application that would help facilitate a user with his or her diet.

The application would do this by asking the user questions about his or her age, height, current weight, activity level and goal weight and use this information to set a specific amount of daily consumable calories for the user depending on if he/she wants to lose weight, gain weight or maintain the same weight. 

The user would keep track of these calories by using the application’s food recognition software which allows a user to scan a food item that he or she is about to eat and then recognizes this food item through camera, based on Food detection dataset (Food 101 dataset).

The app then Classifies the calories of a typical serving size of that food item associated with it based on Food nutrition and information dataset.  

The app then uses IBM Chabot which gives personalized recommendation based on the user’s intake.
